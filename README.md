# A-Search-Algorithm
Side project:

Implementing the A* Search Algorithm using python.

Project Descrition:

One of the most innovative creations in today’s world is the ability of a computer to calculate the shortest distance between point A and point B. The ‘A* search algorithm’ can be used in many areas of computer science such as games, apps, data science and many more. I have used this to create a maze and apply the algorithm to find the optimal pathway towards the exit.

Preparations Taken:

When creating a maze, firstly you have to consider all the characteristics and rules of a maze in order to set a clear structure of how the program will work. 

Maze Characteristics:

1. Many pathways

2. Only one pathway that leads to the exit

3. Obstacles



Program Features:

--> Using a prebuilt Maze with pixels.

--> Allows user to pick start and end location within the maze.

--> View the process of how the A* Search algorithm Operates.

Project Documentation:

I have created a documentation that contains the details of how the program works.
